                            The brain is the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals??only a few invertebrates such as sponges,
                            jellyfish, adult sea squirts and starfish do not have one, even if diffuse neural tissue is present. It is located in the head, usually close to the
                            primary sensory organs for such senses as vision, hearing, balance, taste,and smell. The brain is the most complex organ in a vertrate's body.
                            In a typical human the cerebal cortex (the largest part) is estimated to contain 15--33 billion neurons,[1] each connected by synapses to
                            several thousand other neurons. These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons, which carry
                            trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells.
